<h1>It Is Easier To Let Go</h1>
<body>
    <p> It becomes clear to me<br>
        That it is tougher to hold on<br>
        That it is harder to keep someone around<br>
        And with every passing second <br>
        That I breath <br>
        <br>
        It becomes clearer to me<br>
        That the person to hold unto is myself<br>
        Just like the sky <br>
        That never holds unto anything else<br>
        <br>
        It becomes clear to me<br>
        That moving on is the way of nature<br>
        The sky let go of the rain no matter how refreshing;<br>
        let go of the moon no matter how bright;<br>
        let go of the stars no matter how beautiful;<br>
        let go of the sun no matter how shiny<br>
        <br>
        It has become clearer to me<br>
        That no matter how long it takes<br>
        the rain, the sun, the moon, and the stars<br>
        they always come back to the sky and try again<br>
        <br>
        And so it becomes even clearer to me<br>
        That just like the summer succeeds the winter<br>
        Good days will always succeed the bad days<br>
        And if we can just go back and try again<br>
        Our love will always come back to light<br>
        And we will hold unto us forever<br>
        Even though it is easier to let go<br>
